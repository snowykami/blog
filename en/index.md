  - Seul un adieu fleurira.
  - One moment's repose may sow the seeds of a lifetime's sorrow.
  - Lite thoughts ripple like water, yuki melt a fragrant birth.
  - Whispers of the heart are heard by the universe.
  - Stars shimmer in the night sky, like hopes in the heart.
  - Wisdom is the flower that never fades.
  - Every sunset brings a promise of a new dawn.
